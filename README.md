# Heart-Disease

# Aim:
#### To analyse heart disease using supervised machine learning technique mainly Random forest algorithm so that the understand  Whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not


# objective:
#### Study the person do not have/have not had heart disease 


# Methodology: 
## Data collection: 
#### Data is collected from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/heart-disease-health-indicators-dataset 

## Data Cleaning: 
#### In this step, prepare the data for further analysis by removing null values, transforming and standardizing our data.

## Exploratory Data Analyis: 
#### After cleaning process, study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on correlation between different Variable in dataset.

## Data Preprocessing: 
#### In this step, Feature selection, label encoding and feature scaling process is done.

## Model Development: 
#### In this stage, Data undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to build the model.


# Tools and Technology Used:
## Python 
## Tableau
